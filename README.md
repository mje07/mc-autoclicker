# Autoclicker
A reskin and cleanup of weynn's GitHub clicker, I also embedded the dlls in the release. For the break blocks to work either use a nohitdelay mod in forge 1.8.9 or play in 1.7 like everyone else.

# Compliling

If you want to compile the repo with embedded dlls get the 'Fody' package off NuGet (Project -> Manage NuGet Packages) then build with debug instead of release.

# Preview
